### Description:
[linux-serial-console-installer](https://github.com/jakeogh/linux-serial-console-installer) detects and creates an automatic and persistent login console on a specific USB device. The `server` is the computer providing the login console (usually a small computer like a RasberryPi) and the `client` is any computer used to connect to the `server` over the USB serial device.
