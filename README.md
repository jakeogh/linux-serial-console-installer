### Description:
[linux-serial-console-installer](https://github.com/jakeogh/linux-serial-console-installer) detects and creates an automatic and persistent login console on a specific USB device. The `server` is the computer providing the login console (usually a small computer like a RasberryPi) and the `client` is any computer used to connect to the `server` over the USB serial device.

<em>On the left the USB-RS485-WE goes to the RasberryPi server, on the right the USB-485-1 goes to the client computer.</em>
</p>

### Installation:

#### Debian 11 (server)
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip -y
$ pip install --force-reinstall git+https://git@github.com/jakeogh/linux-serial-console-installer
$ linux-serial-console-installer debian-11
```

That last command will interactively ask the user to select a USB device to attach a persistent login console to whenever it's connected.

If it completed sucessfully, the last line should read:
```"Debian 11 linux-serial-console-installer completed OK, A REBOOT IS REQUIRED."```

### Usage:

#### After rebooting `server`:

1. Plug the USB serial device into `server`.
2. On the `server` execute `sudo systemctl start serial-getty@ttyUSB_0403_6001_console.service` (this is a bug, it should happen automatically)
3. Connect `server` USB device from step 1 to an approprate device connected to a `client` computer.
4. Install `screen` on the `client` computer: `sudo apt install screen -y`
5. On the `client` computer execute: `screen -h 10000 -t 'ttyUSB0 9600 8n1' /dev/ttyUSB0 9600,-ixoff,-ixon` to connect to the serial console on the server. You may need to press ENTER.


### Troubleshooting:

1. On the `server` verify getty is listening on the expected serial device:

```
$ ps -auxw | grep getty
root         628  0.0  0.0   5108  1848 ttyUSB0  Ss+  11:50   0:00 /sbin/agetty -o -p -- \u --keep-baud 115200,57600,38400,9600 ttyUSB_0403_6001_console vt220
user        1627  0.0  0.0   6040   648 pts/0    S+   11:51   0:00 grep --color=auto getty
```

### Examples:
